This is a simple example on how to use C++ code on objective C project

1. Basic C++ class and function
2. Use a wrapper layer to wrap the c++ code onto Objective C++ code
3. On the UI layer, call the Objective C function.

Change the "Complile Source As" variable in compiler settings and set its value to "Objective-C++".
